# Overview {-}

This guide is meant to be a brief step-by-step introduction to get started with jamovi. There are three sections:

* Loading and preparing your data
* Getting an overview of your data using descriptive analyses and graphs
* Running basic statistical analyses


Intended readers are: 

1: Students who need to analyse data and who gets statistical supervision/training from elsewhere
2: Anyone who already uses another statistical software but want to get started using jamovi  


Note that this guide only shows *how* to do analyses with jamovi, it is not a tutorial on prerequisites or interpretations of statistical tests. For that purpose there is plenty of other literature. One example is *learning statistics with jamovi* (2018) by Navarro och Foxcroft, which is a comprehensive statistics book using jamovi. Currently (April 2019) it is available for free online.
