# Welcome {-}

The aim of this website is to provide short, non-technical tutorials on how to do common procedures in jamovi.  

If you require an introduction to both statistics and jamovi, I recommend the free e-book <a href="https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/">Learning statistics with jamovi</a> by Danielle J. Navarro and David R. Foxcroft.
