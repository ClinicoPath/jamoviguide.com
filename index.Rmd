# Overview {-}



This site provides step-by-step tutorials for jamovi. There are three main sections:

* Loading and preparing your data (chapter \@ref(loadData))
* Creating descriptive analyses and graphs (chapter \@ref(descriptives))
* Performing statistical analyses (chapter \@ref(t-test), \@ref(anova), \@ref(regression))


Intended readers are: 

1: Students who need to analyse data and who gets statistical supervision/training from elsewhere  
2: Anyone who already uses another statistical software but want to get started using jamovi  


Note that this guide only shows *how* to do analyses with jamovi, it is not a tutorial on prerequisites or interpretations of statistical tests. For that purpose there is plenty of other literature. One example is *learning statistics with jamovi* (2018) by Navarro och Foxcroft, which is a comprehensive statistics book using jamovi. Currently (April 2019) it is available for free online.
