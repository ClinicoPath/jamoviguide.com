Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Independent Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variables and your grouping variable to Grouping Variable. The result is shown in the right panel 3.2 Paired Samples T-Test To perform a Paired Samples T-Test you need two continous variables. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Paired Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variables to Dependent variables. The result is shown in the right panel 3.3 One Sample T-Test To perform a One Sample T-Test you need a continous variable and a mean to test against. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; One Sample T-Test. Move your dependent variable to Dependent Variables. Locate the section “Hypothesis” further down, this is where you enter the mean you want to test against. The result is shown in the right panel "],
["regression.html", "Part 5 Regression 5.1 Regression 5.2 Logistic Regression", " Part 5 Regression This chapter shows how to perform linear (5.1) and logistic (5.2) regressions 5.1 Regression To perform a linear regression you need two continous variables: one outcome variable and one predictor. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear Regression. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your predictor to Covariates. The result is shown in the right panel: 5.2 Logistic Regression To perform a logistic regression you need a continous predictor and a categorical outcome variable. Therefore, your data should look something like this: If the outcome variable has two levels (as in the above image): select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; 2 Outcomes. If the outcome variable has three or more levels, select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; N Outcomes. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your predictor to Covariates. The result is shown in the right panel: "]
