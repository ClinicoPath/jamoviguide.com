["index.html", "The jamovi quickstart guide Welcome", " The jamovi quickstart guide Jonas Rafi 2019-09-24 Welcome The aim of this website is to provide short, non-technical tutorials (with pictures!) on how to do common procedures in jamovi. Note that the guides focus only on showing how to the analyses in jamovi. They do not cover the assumptions required for a particular analysis or how to interpret the results. If you want to learn statistics and use jamovi, I highly recommend the free e-book Learning statistics with jamovi by Navarro and Foxcroft.

["load-data-into-jamovi.html", "1 Opening data in jamovi", " 1 Opening data in jamovi Opening a file in jamovi To open a file in jamovi, click the menu icon and select Open file -&gt; Browse. Usually, you may want to use data files with “comma-separated values” (.csv or .txt). Other supported file formats are JASP files (.jasp), R files (.RData, .RDS), SAS files (.xpt, .sas7bdat), SPSS files (.sav, .zsav, .por) and Stata files (.dta). Got data in Excel and don’t know how to get it into jamovi? Continue reading about comma delimited data below to find out. Comma delimited files A comma-separated values (csv) file is a text file that uses comma to separate values. The file stores data in plain text, where each line of the file is a record. Despite the name comma-separated, other characters such as semi-colon are sometimes used. See figure 1 below for an example of a .csv-file with semi-colon used. Figure 1: A .csv-file opened in a texteditor. If you have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel), you can create a csv copy of your data by selecting File -&gt; Save as... and choose Comma delimited in the drop-down menu close to the Save as-button. Thereafter, you may open the .csv-file in jamovi. "],
["level-of-measurement.html", "2 Setting the scale of measurement", " 2 Setting the scale of measurement Before conducting analyses in jamovi, you usually need to set the scale of measurement for each variable included in the analysis. When you load data into jamovi, it is common for variables to get the lowest (nominal) level. This means that, for example, if you wish to perform a two sample t-test you would need to set both included variables as “continuous”. How to set the scale of measurement for a variable Double click the variable you want to edit. In the data variable pane, select the desired level: ID, Nominal, Ordinal or Continous. Lastly, press the up arrow to hide the data variable pane, or the left or right arrows to edit another variable. "],
