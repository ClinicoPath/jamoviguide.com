Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Independent Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variables and your grouping variable to Grouping Variable. The result is shown in the right panel 3.2 Paired samples t-test To perform a paired samples t-test you need two continuous variables. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Paired Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variables to Dependent variables. The result is shown in the right panel 3.3 One-sample t-test To perform a one-sample t-test you need a continuous variable and a mean to test against. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; One Sample T-Test. Move your dependent variable to Dependent Variables. Locate the section “Hypothesis” further down, this is where you enter the mean you want to test against. The result is shown in the right panel "],

Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; ANOVA. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your grouping variable to Fixed Factors. The results is shown in the right pane: 4.2 Factorial ANOVA To perform a factorial ANOVA you need two grouping variables and one outcome variable (continuous). Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; ANOVA. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your grouping variables to Fixed Factors. The result is shown in the right pane: 4.3 Repeated measures ANOVA To perform a repeated measures ANOVA you need an outcome variable (continuous) where every measurement has its own column. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the box Repeated Measures Factors: write the name of your outcome variable (e.g. My_scale) and name the levels for each measurement occasion (e.g. Pre, Post and 12 month follow-up). The images below shows the box with default values (left) and when the values has been set (right). -&gt; Move your outcome variables to their respective cells in Repeated Measures Cells. The results are shown in the right pane: 4.4 Mixed ANOVA To perform a mixed ANOVA, you need a grouping variable and an outcome variable (continuous) where each measurement occasion has its own column. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the box Repeated Measures Factors: write the name of your outcome variable (e.g. My_scale) and name the levels for each measurement occasion (e.g. Pre, Post and 12 month follow-up). The below images illustrates this. -&gt; Move your outcome variables to their respective cells in Repeated Measures Cells. Move your grouping variables to Between Subject Factors.
