["loadData.html", "1 Loading and preparing data 1.1 File format 1.2 Data format 1.3 Data types", " 1 Loading and preparing data When opening and preparing a data file in jamovi, you need to consider three things: the file format the data format the data type Next, your data format should be in the wide data format (1.2) to be able to perform common analyses like t-test, ANOVA or regression. Once loaded into jamovi, you need to select the appropriate data type (1.3) for each variable. 1.1 File format If your data file was created by another statistical software (SPSS, Stata, SAS or JASP), you can load that file into jamovi. However, it is likely that your data is in another file format (e.g. Excel). In that case, you need to save your data as a comma delimited file. 1.1.1 Comma delimited data A comma delimited file has the filename extension “.csv” and contains unformated text, where cells are separated by a semi-colon (se figure 1 below) or another special character. If you have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel), you can create a csv-file of your data by selecting File -&gt; Save as... and choose Comma delimited in the drop-down menu near the Save as-button. Figure 1: A .csv-file opened in a texteditor. 1.2 Data format Your data needs to be in wide format in order to perform analyses like t-test, ANOVA and regression. Wide data (se figure 2A below) means that there is only one row per participant. This is contrast to long format (se figure 2B below) where each participant may have multiple rows. Figure 2A: Data in wide format. Figure 2B: Data i long format. 1.3 Data types How to set the data type in jamovi: Double click the variable you want to change. In the data variable pane, set the variable as ID, Nominal, Ordinal or Continous. Lastly, press the up arrow to hide the data variable pane, or the right arrow to go to the next variable. "],
["descriptives.html", "2 Descriptive analyses", " 2 Descriptive analyses This chapter provides an overview on how to perform descriptive analyses and create graphs in jamovi. If you have not yet loaded and prepared your data, have a look at the previous chapter (1) first. When you are ready to perform your descriptive analysis, follow the steps below: Select Analyses -&gt; Exploration -&gt; Descriptives. Move the variables you want descriptive analyses for to Varibles. The result is shown in the right panel. Right click the output to save or copy it. To split your descriptive analyses on a categorical variable (e.g. to separate by gender), move that variable to Split by. Click the Statistics tab to see more alternatives To create a plot, click the Plots tab and tick the box of your desired plot. The plot is based on your choices in step 2. "],
["t-test.html", "3 t-test 3.1 Independent samples t-test 3.2 Paired samples t-test 3.3 One-sample t-test", " 3 t-test This chapter shows how to conduct t-tests using independent samples (3.1), paired samples (3.2) and one-sample (3.3). 3.1 Independent samples t-test How to perform an independent samples t-test in jamovi: Check that you have a continous outcome variable and a grouping variable with two levels. This means that your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Independent Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variables and your grouping variable to Grouping Variable. The result is shown in the right panel 3.2 Paired samples t-test How to perform a paired samples t-test in jamovi: Check that your have two continuous variables. This means that your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Paired Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variables to Dependent variables. The result is shown in the right panel 3.3 One-sample t-test How to perform a one-sample t-test in jamovi: You need one continuous variable and a mean to test against. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; One Sample T-Test. Move your dependent variable to Dependent Variables. Locate the section Hypothesis further down, this is where you enter the mean you want to test against. The result is shown in the right panel "],
["anova.html", "4 ANOVA 4.1 ANOVA 4.2 Factorial ANOVA 4.3 Repeated measures ANOVA 4.4 Mixed ANOVA", " 4 ANOVA This chapter shows how to conduct an ANOVA (4.1) and its extensions factorial ANOVA (4.2), repeated measures ANOVA (4.3), and mixed ANOVA (4.4). 4.1 ANOVA How to perform an ANOVA in jamovi: Check that your data contains a grouping variable and a continuous outcome variable. Your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; ANOVA. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your grouping variable to Fixed Factors. The results is shown in the right pane: 4.2 Factorial ANOVA How to perform a factorial ANOVA in jamovi: Check that your data contains two grouping variables and a continuous outcome variable. Your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; ANOVA. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your grouping variables to Fixed Factors. The result is shown in the right pane: 4.3 Repeated measures ANOVA How to perform a repeated measures ANOVA in jamovi: Check that your data contains a continuous outcome variable and that the data format is wide. Your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the box Repeated Measures Factors: write the name of your outcome variable (e.g. My_scale) and name the levels for each measurement occasion (e.g. Pre, Post and 12 month follow-up). The images below shows the box with default values (left) and when the values has been set (right). -&gt; Move your outcome variables to their respective cells in Repeated Measures Cells. The results are shown in the right pane: 4.4 Mixed ANOVA How to perform a mixed ANOVA in jamovi: You need one grouping variable and a continuous outcome variable. Also, the data should be in the wide data format. Your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the box Repeated Measures Factors: write the name of your outcome variable (e.g. My_scale) and name the levels for each measurement occasion (e.g. Pre, Post and 12 month follow-up). The below images illustrates this. -&gt; Move your outcome variables to their respective cells in Repeated Measures Cells. Move your grouping variables to Between Subject Factors. The result is shown in the right panel: "],
["regression.html", "5 Regression 5.1 Linear regression 5.2 Logistic regression", " 5 Regression This chapter shows how to perform linear (5.1) and logistic (5.2) regressions 5.1 Linear regression To perform a linear regression you need two continuous variables: one outcome variable and one predictor variable. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear Regression. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your predictor to Covariates. The result is shown in the right panel: 5.2 Logistic regression To perform a logistic regression you need a continuous predictor variable and a categorical outcome variable. Therefore, your data should look something like this: If the outcome variable has two levels (as in the above image): select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; 2 Outcomes. If the outcome variable has three or more levels, select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; N Outcomes. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your predictor to Covariates. The result is shown in the right panel: "],
