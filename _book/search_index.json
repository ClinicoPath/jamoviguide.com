Common data formats to use are “comma-separated files” (.csv or .txt). Other supported file formats are JASP files (.jasp), R files (.RData, .RDS), SAS files (.xpt, .sas7bdat), SPSS files (.sav, .zsav, .por) and Stata files (.dta). Got data in Excel and don’t know how to get it into jamovi? Continue reading about comma delimited data below to find out. Comma delimited data A comma delimited file has the filename extension “.csv” and contains unformated text, where cells are separated by a semi-colon (se figure 1 below) or another special character. If you have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel), you can create a csv copy of your data by selecting File -&gt; Save as... and choose Comma delimited in the drop-down menu close to the Save as-button.

["level-of-measurement.html", "2 Setting the scale of measurement", " 2 Setting the scale of measurement Before conducting analyses in jamovi, you usually need to set the scale of measurement for each variable included in the analysis. When you load data in jamovi, it is common for the variables to get the lowest (nominal) level. This means that, for example, if you wish to perform a two sample t-test you would need to set both included variables as “continuous”. How to set the scale of measurement for a variable Double click the variable you want to edit. In the data variable pane, set the variable as ID, Nominal, Ordinal or Continous. Lastly, press the up arrow to hide the data variable pane, or the left or right arrows to edit another variable. "],
