["index.html", "jamovi quickstart guide Overview", " jamovi quickstart guide Jonas Rafi Overview This guide is meant to be a brief step-by-step introduction to get started with jamovi. There are three sections: Loading and preparing your data Getting an overview of your data using descriptive analyses and graphs Running basic statistical analyses Intended readers are: 1: Students who need to analyse data and who gets statistical supervision/training from elsewhere 2: Anyone who already uses another statistical software but want to get started using jamovi Note that this guide only shows how to do analyses with jamovi, it is not a tutorial on prerequisites or interpretations of statistical tests. For that purpose there is plenty of other literature. One example is learning statistics with jamovi (2018) by Navarro och Foxcroft, which is a comprehensive statistics book using jamovi. Currently (April 2019) it is available for free online. Download jamovi at www.jamovi.org Comments and questions are very welcome. Contact me at jonas.rafi [at] psychology.su or at github. Feel free to fork the repository on GitHub and translate it into another language. "],
["loadData.html", "Part 1 Loading and preparing data 1.1 Comma delimited data 1.2 Wide data 1.3 Opening a file", " Part 1 Loading and preparing data You can load data into jamovi using either data files used in other statistical software (SPSS, Stata, SAS, JASP) or from textfiles (.txt or .csv files) with comma delimited data. If your data file is not associated with another statistical software, then you may want to look at the csv-section below first (1.1). Regardless of the type of data file, your data should be in the wide format (1.2) to be able to perform common analyses like t-test, ANOVA or regression. When you have your data file with wide data ready, all you need to do is open the file (1.3) in jamovi. 1.1 Comma delimited data A comma delimited file has the filename extension .csv and contains unformated text, where cells are separated by a semi-colon (se picture below) or another special character. If your have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel), you can create a csv-file of your data by selecting File -&gt; Save as... and choose Comma delimited in the drop-down menu near the Save as-button. Figure 1: A .csv-file opened in a texteditor. 1.2 Wide data Your data needs to be in the wide format in order to perform analyses like t-test, ANOVA and regression. Wide data (se figure 2A below) means that every participant has one row only. This is contrast to the long format (se figure 2B below) where each participant may have multiple rows. Figure 2A: Data in wide format. Figure 2B: Data i long format. 1.3 Opening a file Click the menu icon in the top left corner. Make sure that This PC/Mac is selected and click Browse Locate your data file and click open. "],
["descriptive-analyses.html", "Part 2 Descriptive analyses", " Part 2 Descriptive analyses This chapter provides an overview of how you perform descriptive analyses and create graphs. If you have not yet loaded and prepared your data, have a look at the previous chapter (1) first. When you are ready to perform your descriptive analysis, follow the steps below: Select Analyses -&gt; Exploration -&gt; Descriptives. Move the variables you want to descriptive analyses for to Varibles. The result is shown in the right panel. Right click the output to save or copy it. To split your descriptive analyses on a categorical variable (e.g. separate by gender), move that variable to Split by. Click the tab Statistics to see more alternatives To create a plot, click Plots and tick a box to create a plot corresponding to your choices in step 2. "],
["t-test.html", "Part 3 t-test 3.1 Independent samples t-test 3.2 Paired samples t-test 3.3 One-sample t-test", " Part 3 t-test This chapter shows how to conduct t-tests using independent samples (3.1), paired samples (3.2) and one-sample (3.3). 3.1 Independent samples t-test To perform an independent samples t-test you need an outcome variable (continuous) and a grouping variable with two levels. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Independent Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variables and your grouping variable to Grouping Variable. The result is shown in the right panel 3.2 Paired samples t-test To perform a paired samples t-test you need two continuous variables. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; Paired Samples T-Test. Move your outcome variables to Dependent variables. The result is shown in the right panel 3.3 One-sample t-test To perform a one-sample t-test you need a continuous variable and a mean to test against. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; T-Tests -&gt; One Sample T-Test. Move your dependent variable to Dependent Variables. Locate the section “Hypothesis” further down, this is where you enter the mean you want to test against. The result is shown in the right panel "],
["anova.html", "Part 4 ANOVA 4.1 ANOVA 4.2 Factorial ANOVA 4.3 Repeated measures ANOVA 4.4 Mixed ANOVA", " Part 4 ANOVA This chapter shows how to conduct an ANOVA (4.1) and its extensions factorial ANOVA (4.2), repeated measures ANOVA (4.3), and mixed ANOVA (4.4). 4.1 ANOVA To perform a “simple” ANOVA you need a grouping variable and an outcome variable (continuous). Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; ANOVA. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your grouping variable to Fixed Factors. The results is shown in the right pane: 4.2 Factorial ANOVA To perform a factorial ANOVA you need two grouping variables and one outcome variable (continuous). Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; ANOVA. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your grouping variables to Fixed Factors. The result is shown in the right pane: 4.3 Repeated measures ANOVA To perform a repeated measures ANOVA you need an outcome variable (continuous) where every measurement has its own column. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the box Repeated Measures Factors: write the name of your outcome variable (e.g. My_scale) and name the levels for each measurement occasion (e.g. Pre, Post and 12 month follow-up). The images below shows the box with default values (left) and when the values has been set (right). -&gt; Move your outcome variables to their respective cells in Repeated Measures Cells. The results are shown in the right pane: 4.4 Mixed ANOVA To perform a mixed ANOVA, you need a grouping variable and an outcome variable (continuous) where each measurement occasion has its own column. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; ANOVA -&gt; Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the box Repeated Measures Factors: write the name of your outcome variable (e.g. My_scale) and name the levels for each measurement occasion (e.g. Pre, Post and 12 month follow-up). The below images illustrates this. -&gt; Move your outcome variables to their respective cells in Repeated Measures Cells. Move your grouping variables to Between Subject Factors. The result is shown in the right panel: "],
["regression.html", "Part 5 Regression 5.1 Linear regression 5.2 Logistic regression", " Part 5 Regression This chapter shows how to perform linear (5.1) and logistic (5.2) regressions 5.1 Linear regression To perform a linear regression you need two continuous variables: one outcome variable and one predictor variable. Therefore, your data should look something like this: Select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; Linear Regression. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your predictor to Covariates. The result is shown in the right panel: 5.2 Logistic regression To perform a logistic regression you need a continuous predictor variable and a categorical outcome variable. Therefore, your data should look something like this: If the outcome variable has two levels (as in the above image): select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; 2 Outcomes. If the outcome variable has three or more levels, select Analyses -&gt; Regression -&gt; N Outcomes. Move your outcome variable to Dependent Variable and your predictor to Covariates. The result is shown in the right panel: "],
