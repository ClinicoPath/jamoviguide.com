#### How to perform a factorial ANOVA in jamovi: {-}


1. You need two grouping variables and one continuous outcome variable. Make sure that the measurement levels are set^[This is demonstrated in section \@ref(level-of-measurement).] so that the grouping variables are marked with <img src="images/icons/nominal.JPG" width="3%" alt=" grouped data icon"/> and the continuous variable is marked with <img src="images/icons/continuous.JPG" width="3%" alt=" the continuous data icon"/>.  
A correct setup should look similar to this:
