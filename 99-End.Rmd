# Where to go next

If you require an introduction to both statistics and jamovi, I recommend the free e-book <a href="https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/">Learning statistics with jamovi</a> by Danielle J. Navarro and David R. Foxcroft.

Questions regardin jamovi can be asked in the forum at <a href="forum.jamovi.org/">jamovi.org</a>.
