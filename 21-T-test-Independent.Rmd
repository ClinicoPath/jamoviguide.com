##### How to perform an independent samples t-test in jamovi: {-}

1. You need one grouping variable with two levels (e.g. treatment/control) and one continuous outcome variable. Make sure that the grouping variable is marked with <img src="images/icons/nominal.JPG" width="3%" alt=" grouped data icon"/> and the continuous variable is marked with <img src="images/icons/continuous.JPG" width="3%" alt=" the continuous data icon"/> (see section \@ref(level-of-measurement)).  
A correct setup should look similar to this:
