Common data formats to use are "comma-separated files" (.csv or .txt). Other supported file formats are JASP files (.jasp), R files (.RData, .RDS), SAS files (.xpt, .sas7bdat), SPSS files (.sav, .zsav, .por) and Stata files (.dta).

Got data in Excel and don't know how to get it into jamovi? Continue reading about comma delimited data below to find out.


__Comma delimited data__

A comma delimited file has the filename extension ".csv" and contains unformated text, where cells are separated by a semi-colon (se figure 1 below) or another special character. If you have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel), you can create a csv copy of your data by selecting `File` -> `Save as...` and choose `Comma delimited` in the drop-down menu close to the `Save as`-button.
