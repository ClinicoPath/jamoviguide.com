# Loading and preparing data {#loadData}


You can load data into jamovi using either data files used in other statistical software (SPSS, Stata, SAS, JASP) or from textfiles (.txt or .csv files) with __comma delimited data__. If your data file is not associated with another statistical software, then you may want to look at the csv-section below first (\@ref(csvData)). Regardless of the type of data file, your data should be in the __wide format__ (\@ref(wideData)) to be able to perform common analyses like t-test, ANOVA or regression. When you have your data file with wide data ready, all you need to do is __open the file__ (\@ref(openFile)) in jamovi.


## Comma delimited data {#csvData}

A comma delimited file has the filename extension .csv and contains unformated text, where cells are separated by a semi-colon (se picture below) or another special character. If your have your data in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel), you can create a csv-file of your data by selecting `File -> Save as...` and choose `Comma delimited` in the drop-down menu near the `Save as`-button.

## Wide data {#wideData}

Your data needs to be in the _wide format_ in order to perform analyses like t-test, ANOVA and regression. Wide data (se figure 2A below) means that every participant has one row only. This is contrast to the _long format_ (se figure 2B below) where each participant may have multiple rows.

2. Make sure that `This PC/Mac` is selected and click `Browse`
