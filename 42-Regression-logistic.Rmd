##### How to perform a logistic regression in jamovi: {-}

1. You need one continuous predictor variable and one categorical outcome variable. Make sure that the continuous variable is marked with <img src="images/icons/continuous.JPG" width="3%" alt=" the continuous data icon"/> and the grouping variable is marked with <img src="images/icons/nominal.JPG" width="3%" alt=" grouped data icon"/> (see section \@ref(level-of-measurement)).  
A correct setup should look similar to this:

2. If the outcome variable has two levels (as in the above image): select `Analyses` -> `Regression` -> `2 Outcomes`. If the outcome variable has three or more levels, select `Analyses` -> `Regression` -> `N Outcomes`.

3. Drag and drop your outcome variable to __Dependent Variable__ and your predictor to __Covariates__.
