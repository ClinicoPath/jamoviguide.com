#### How to perform a linear regression in jamovi: {-}

1. You need two continuous variables (one predictor and one dependent variable). Make sure that the measurement levels are set^[This is demonstrated in section \@ref(level-of-measurement).] so that both variables are marked with <img src="images/icons/continuous.JPG" width="3%" alt=" the continuous data icon"/>.  
A correct setup should look similar to this:
