# Setting the scale of measurement {#level-of-measurement}

Before conducting analyses in jamovi, you usually need to set the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement">scale of measurement</a> for each variable included in the analysis. When you load data into jamovi, it is common for variables to get the lowest (nominal) level. This means that, for example, if you wish to perform a two sample t-test you would need to set both included variables as "continuous".
